        <h1 class="title">Humour on the internet</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Understanding online humour</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Since the 1990s, we’ve witnessed the rise of the internet. From professional use to personal life, 
                it now permeates every moment and every space. 
                With such a profound influence come shifts and developments that reshape society. 
                One particular change we wanted to explore is the evolution of humour. 
                For more than two decades, people have interacted on social media through comment
                 sections, blogs, posts, and videos and the ways we express
                 humour have transformed. Let’s take a closer look at these new forms of humour !


            <h2>I. Fragmented Sentences </h2>
            <h3>The "Me:" Construction</h3>
            <p>
                The “Me:” construction is a type of internet 
                joke that has become very popular online. The joke works by skipping 
                over a lot of explanation. It shows point A and point B without explaining what happens in between 
                and that contrast creates humour because it’s relatable.
                It’s simple, instantly recognizable. 
            
                 
               <p>Example:
                <p>“me: i’ll just have one drink / also me: shots shots shots” </p> 
                <p> “me, acting normal:  / also me, internally: screaming” </p>
                <p>It tells an entire story in two lines. 
                There’s no setup, no background
                just a contrast that everyone understands.
                <p>There’s a variation, it’s basically the same joke, but it expands it into an internal dialogue
                rather than an external scenario.</p>
                <p> Example:
                <p>“me: i’m finally gonna start saving money / also me: buys another vinyl.”</p>
                <p>“me: i hate drama / also me: what happened next???”</p>
                <p> It narrates one's own contradictions with full acceptance. This construction works because
                    it mimics the way people actually think, turning inner dialogue into 
                     language.</p>
                </p>
            
            <h4>II. Deliberate Mistakes</h4>
            <h5>Intentional misspellings</h5>
            <p>Deliberate mistakes and misspellings involve 
                intentionally writing something wrong to create humor. It’s about using bad spelling on purpose.</p>
                <p>Example:
                <p>“I can’t believe it’s not butter” becomes “I can’t believe it’s not buttr”</p>
                <p>“Stay safe” becomes “Stay saef”</p>
                <p>Humour comes from the gap between expectation and reality. 
                    It works because it breaks the rules of language and expectations deliberately.
                Grammar mistakes usually signal carelessness or inattention, but here they are intentional and used to create humour. 
                They also create a sense of closeness, as the person who posted this comes across as being ‘just like us.’ </p>
            <p>Other examples :</p>
            <p> "Friends" becomes "frens"</p>
            <p>"Small" becomes "smol"</p>
            <p> The language feels innocent, almost childlike, which adds to its absurdity. 
                It’s like writing the way a small child might talk. What’s interesting is
                 that this style doesn’t just make people laugh but it creates a shared tone of unseriousness.
                Deliberate mistakes function as a form of visual humour.</p>

            <h6> III. GIFs</h6>
            <p>GIF stands for “Graphics Interchange Format” and was created by Steve Wilhite in 1987. It typically consists of a short 
                looping animation of one or two seconds. A GIF can feature a scene from a film, a cartoon, or an internet video, but it
                 can also be a simple image paired with text or an exaggerated facial expression. They often reference recognisable 
                 pop-culture moments which makes them easy to share and understand across different online communities. Over time, 
                 certain GIFs have become "internet classics" like the blinking white guy, the Michael Jackson popcorn GIF, or the Barack Obama mic 
                 drop.  (available in <a href="meme-library.html" class=>meme-library</a>)
                 They have become famous because they capture emotions or reactions that people frequently use in online conversations.</p>
                
            <h6> IV. Memes</h6>
            <p> Internet memes are images, videos, or phrases that spread online, 
                sometimes using features such as fragmented sentences or deliberate mistakes as discussed earlier on this website. They evolve as people remix and share them. A meme often carries irony.
                 For a meme to go viral, it has to be relatable, meaning people can recognise themselves in it, 
                 and it has to be simple and easy to understand. You can find examples of memes in  <a href="meme-library.html" class=>meme-library</a></p> 
            <h5 class="h7">Juxtaposition</h5>
                <p>Memes often use juxtaposition to create humour. 
                    Juxtaposition is when two contrasting ideas or images are placed side by side to highlight their differences.</p>
                <p> Example :</p>
                <p>A picture of a tiny kitten labeled: “CEO of a billion-dollar company”
                <p>A picture of a messy room labeled: “My life in a nutshell”</p>
                <p>The humour comes from the contrast between the image and the caption. 
                    The unexpected pairing creates humour and highlights the absurdity of the situation.</p>

            <h5 class="h8">A Brief History Of Memes </h5>
           <p> The word “meme” was coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene (1976).
             He described how ideas and behaviours spread and evolve within a culture, in a way similar to how genes 
             evolve in biology. He defines a “meme” as a concept used to discuss evolutionary principles when explaining the 
             spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. According to him, a meme is a unit of cultural transmission that spreads 
             from person to person and evolves through imitation and variation.</p>
            <p>David L. Hull, an American philosopher of science, expanded Richard Dawkins’ original concept of memes. 
                He based his work on a three-part evolutionary system consisting of replicators, interactors and lineages. 
                The replicator is the meme itself, for example, an idea, a tune or a behaviour. The interactor is the person or 
                object that carries the meme such as a speaker, a piece of writing or a video. The lineage is the 
                historical chain of copied and modified versions of a meme. Alternatively, Daniel Dennett, an American philosopher 
                and cognitive scientist, suggests that the medium and the idea are not distinct, memes only exist because of their medium.</p>
                <p>Later, in 2013, Limor Shifman, a communication scholar, contributed significantly to the study of internet memes.
                     Her book "Memes in Digital Culture" (2013) helped define how memes spread on the internet and how they influence 
                     culture. She draws from Dawkins’ ideas but adapts them to the digital age. She highlights that meme culture 
                     is a participatory culture because users actively create and remix which also allow ordinary people to take 
                     part in public conversation. 
            <p>Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist specialised in internet communication, describes memes as building blocks of 
                internet communication. According to her, they are not just jokes but cultural units that carry shared references.
                 In her own words “creating, sharing or laughing at a meme is staking a claim to being an insider.” </p>

            <p>Together, these thinkers show how memes have evolved from a theoretical concept grounded in human biology
                 to a central feature of digital communication. Dawkins, Hull and Dennett explain how ideas replicate through 
                 variation and imitation, using biological evolution as a reference. Shifman and McCulloch demonstrate how the 
                 internet has transformed memes into meaningful cultural units that spread rapidly and shape online humor.</p>
</p>
            <h6>So what makes humour on the internet so different from humour in real life ?</h6>
            <p> There are many reasons for that difference. The first is probably the reliance on written language. 
            Because text removes tone, humor adapts to compensate. Without facial expressions or body language, people rely on irony, 
            hyperbole, absurdity or repeated templates. Over time, the internet has developed its own forms of humor, along 
            with its own references and culture.<p>
            <p>Of course, the internet also contains more conventional forms of humour similar to those found in real life. 
                Humour that has worked for decades eventually appears online because it relies on familiar codes that continue 
                to be effective. Some forms of irony are not unique to the internet, they also exist offline but they have become 
                strongly associated with Generation Z and, by extension, with internet culture. It is difficult to determine 
                whether internet humour influenced real-life humour or whether Gen Z humour shaped online humour. 
                Most likely, the influence goes both ways, especially since Gen Z is highly active on social media. 
                </p>
                <p>       In the end, internet humour cannot be separated from the culture that produces it. The internet has
                 too much impact not to have transformed culture and communication. Humour is clear proof of this influence, 
                 it has evolved side by side with the internet to become a cultural reference in its own right even influencing 
                 real-life humour.</p>
